# Muezzin Project

Over the past few years, Israeli security forces have faced complex challenges in various arenas of operation. Recently, we have witnessed the development of a new threat, characterized by the use of digital platforms, primarily podcasts, to spread incitement against Israel and its institutions around the world.

For this purpose, we have developed a project that will help detect dangerous content and provide advance warning.
